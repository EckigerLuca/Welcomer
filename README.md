# Welcomer
Simple Python Discord bot

# Features:

This simple bot sends an welcome message to a specific channel and DMs the new member. The new member then needs to verify with a command and a random generated code.

After verification, the user will receive a role.



# Setup:

Create an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications

Make sure to add the SERVER MEMBERS INTENT.


After that, run `pip3 install discord.py datetime os json random asyncio Pillow`. (Please tell me if I forgot something. Just DM me on Discord: EckigerLuca#0001)

Then, open the main.py file in an editor and add your token at the top:
